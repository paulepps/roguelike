A Game Intended Intentionally and Specifically for Jeffery

How to Play the Game (I think):
- Download onto Github Desktop / Download the Zip file
- Go into a java compiler (such as BlueJ, possibly Eclipse but I haven't gotten it to work yet)
- Locate the folder within the Github folder labeled "games4jeffpackage"
- Import folder into java compiler
- Compile the files
- Run the class labeled Main
- Enjoy!
